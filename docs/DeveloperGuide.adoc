= Welcome to Planno

Planno is a Java application that helps users to conveniently manage contact as well as event details. To achieve this, Planno provides a large number of easy to use commands for users. +

There are many ways to contribute to Planno: coding, testing, improving the build process and tools, or contributing to the documentation. This guide provides information that will not only help you get started as a Planno contributor, but that you'll find useful to refer to even if you are already an experienced contributor. +

This developer guide aims to give future programmers who hope to modify this application a general description of the architecture and design of the Desktop Application Planno.
Planno provides users a platform to store and manage people's contact information, and events related to people in Planno. This developer guide consists of the following sections:

toc::[]

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* _(Figure 2.1.1)_ given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* (At app launch) Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* (At app shut down) Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by other components. Among them, the following two classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class is written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]. Components communicate with each other by posting event in this class (i.e. a form of event-driven nature of design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four major components:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components above

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The *_Sequence Diagram_* _(Figure 2.1.2)_ below shows how the components interact using event center for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below _(Figure 2.1.3)_ shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.
----
The sections below give more details of each component.
----

=== Four major components
==== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The structure of the `UI` Component is shown in the *_Class Diagram_* _(Figure 2.2.1)_ above. The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Logic component

The diagrams _(Figure 2.2.2.1 to Figure 2.2.2.3)_ given below show the structure of whole logic component, and structure of commands in details. +

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.2.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.2.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The logic will perform the following steps:

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the *_Sequence Diagram_* _(Figure 2.2.2.3)_ for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.2.3 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

==== Model component

The following diagram _(Figure 2.2.3)_ shows the class structure of the Model component.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.3 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

Generally, the `Model` is managed by a Model manager, which

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* maintains an `AddressBook` and a `EventList`.
* stores 2 unmodifiable list: `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` and `ObservableList<ReadOnlyEvent>`. They are bounded to UI so that the UI can automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

In detail, the `AddressBook` and the `EventList` are respectively responsible for person and event information.

* The `AddressBook`
** stores people's information as a person list with no duplicate persons. The information includes one's personal information and contact details.
** keeps track of all the tags that had been added to some people in the person list
** for each person in the list, the person holds a modifiable tag list that contains all the tag this person has.

* The `EventList`
** stores event's information as an event list.
** for each event in the list, the event maintains a modifiable list to keep track of who the participants of the events are.

==== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.4 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The diagram _(Figure 2.2.4)_ above shows the structure of the `Storage` component.

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save event storage data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism
==== General implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram _(Figure 3.1.1.1)_ shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.1 Structure of commands_

As you can see from the diagram _(Figure 3.1.1.1)_, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...
        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
    protected abstract void undo();
}

[source,java]
public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
    @Override
    protected void undo() {
        // ... undo delete logic ...
    }
}


Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command). This is shown in the image _(Figure 3.1.1.2)_ below.

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.2 undo example part 1_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person. This is show in the image _(Figure 3.1.1.3)_ below.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.3 undo example part 2_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed. This is shown in the image _(Figure 3.1.1.4)_ below.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.4 undo example part 3_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 3.1.1.5)_ shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.5 undo sequential diagram_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow). This is shown in the image _(Figure 3.1.1.6)_ below.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.6 redo example part 1_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution. This is shown in the image _(Figure 3.1.1.7)_ below.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.1.7 redo example part 2_

The following *_activity diagram_* _(Figure 3.1.1.8)_ summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command.

[discrete]
===== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
**Alternative 2:** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +

---

*Next, we will show specific implementation for each type of command:* +

==== Undo an adding command
* We keep the person added by that command.
* To undo it, we delete it from the address book.
* To redo it, we re-add it to the address book.

[NOTE]
The person is associated with a list of tags, and we need to eliminate them when we undo. +

.The whole process is following:
.. When we add a person to address book:
1. Extract all tags which are associated with this person but not in the tag list before executing add command. +
2. Keep the tags extracted in step 1 in another list named `newTags`. +
3. Continue executing add command. +
.. When we undo this add command:
1. Delete the person from address book. +
2. Remove all tags which are in `newTags` from the tag list in the address book. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Add this person into address book (Since newTags has already existed).

---

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** How to deal with tags when we undo add command. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove all tags which only exists in this person. +
**Pros:** This allows to undo add command completely. +
**Cons:** Need to ensure each tag to be removed does not exist in any other person. +
**Alternative 2:** Do not remove any tag. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Tag list is not revert to the state before add command executing.

==== Undo an delete command
* We keep the person to be deleted, and his position in the address book.
* To undo it, we add this person to the original position in the address book.
* To redo it, we delete this person from the address book.

.The whole process is following:
.. When we delete a person from the address book:
1. Get the target person by `index`. +
2. Store both target person and the `index`. +
3. Continue executing delete command. +
.. When we undo this delete command:
1. Add target person to the position `index`. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Delete the target person. +

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Where to add the target person when we undo the delete person. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add it to the original position `index`. +
**Pros:** This allows to undo delete command completely, and the sequence of persons in address book will not change because of undoing. +
**Cons:** Need to spend more time adding a person in the middle of the list, because it requires all persons behind `index` to switch to right. +
**Alternative 2:** Just add it at the back of address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, and more efficient. +
**Cons:** The sequence of persons in address book will change. +

---

==== Undo an edit command
* We keep the `personToEdit` and the `editedPerson`.
* To undo it, we swap the role of `personToEdit` and `editedPerson`, and edit it.
* To redo it, we swap back the role and re-edit it.

[NOTE]
Similar as `add` command, if the `editedPerson` causes some change in `tagList`, we need to remove such tags accordingly. +

.The whole process is following:
.. When we edit a person to address book:
1. Extract all tags which are associated with `editedPerson` but not in the tag list before executing edit command. +
2. Keep the tags extracted in step 1 in another list named `newTags`. +
3. Continue executing add command. +
.. When we undo this edit command:
1. Swap the role of `personToEdit` and `editedPerson`. +
2. Execute edit operation. +
3. Remove all tags which are in `newTags` from the tag list in the address book. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Swap back the role of `personToEdit` and `editedPerson`
2. Execute edit operation (Since newTags has already existed). +

---

==== Undo an clear command
* We can only keep the whole copy of address book to undo clear command.
* To undo it, we reset the data of the address book.
* To redo it, we clear the address book again.

.The whole process is following:
.. When we clear the address book:
1. Keep a copy of the address book. +
2. Assign an empty address book to clear the address book. +
.. When we undo this clear command:
1. Reset the data as the copy of address book. +
.. When we redo this command:
1. Assign an empty address book to the model. +
// end::undoredo[]

//tag:: find[]
=== Find mechanism
The Find mechanism is facilitated by `NameContainsKeyWordPredicate` class, which resides in `model.person` package. This command
supports users of finding a list of persons by tags and names. Any person that have either of the entered keyword will be filtered
into the list. Such command will inherit from `Command`.

The find command accept two types of keyword:

* `tag`: it is identified by a prefix `t/`. +
e.g. `find t/friends` means to find any person that have a tag called `friends`
* `name`: anything that do not begin with `tag` is identified as `name` key word. +
e.g. `find friends` means to find any person whose name contains the keyword `friends`
[NOTE]
if a `tag name` is not preceded with a prefix `t/`, then the `tag name` will be identified as a `person name`. As a result, the people with their name containing the `tag name` will be displayed.

Below is a *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 3.2)_ for executing a find command: `find t/friends`. It will find persons that have the tag `friends`.

image::findSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2: sequence diagram for find command_

The command will be sent to LogicManager, and LogicManager will call AddressBookParser to parse
the command. Subsequently, FindCommandParser will parse argument `t/friends` and create a new `findCommand` with
predicate `t/friends`. The `findCommand` is then executed in LogicManager, during which the `findCommand` will update
the filtered person list with predicate tag called `friends`. This update will cause the person list displayed in GUI to be updated,
so that the persons with tag `friends` will be displayed.

[discrete]
==== Design considerations

---
**Aspect:**  implementation of find command +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select people that has any of the keywords +
**Pros:**  For every person, we only need to ensure at least on keyword exist, so we don't need to go through every information of a person.   +
**Cons:**  It is difficult to know by which keyword a person is selected +
**Alternative 2:** Select people that has any of the keywords, and highlight selected keywords in each person's `person card`. +
**Pros:** Shows clearly what keywords each selected person contains. +
**Cons:**  We need to go through everything of a person, in order to highlight EVERY keyword the person has +

---
**Aspect:** Type of keywords that can be found +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only person name and tag can be used in the find command +
**Pros:** We only need to check a person's name and tag list to find match +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all information of a person (i.e. phone, email, address) +
**Pros:** a person can be found in more ways +
**Cons:** implementation is complicated


// tag::sort[]
=== Sort mechanism

The sort command is facilitated by the `LogicManager` class. It supports sorting contact list and makes it easier for users to find contacts they want according to alphabetical order.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 3.3)_ shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3: sequence diagram for sort command_

The user enters a sort command which is got by `LogicManager`.
`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
Then `AddressBookParser` creates the sort command object and return it.
`LogicManager` receives the command object and executes the command.
The sort command object calls `sortPersons()` in the `Model`.
Then `Model` returns the sorted list.
The sort command object receives the sorted list and creates `CommandResult` object and return it.
`LogicManager` receives the result and shows it through `UI`.

[discrete]
==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** How sort command affects the data +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts the copy of contact list and return it. +
**Pros:** It is more defensive and keep the data unchanged. +
**Cons:** Users have to sort the list every time when they open the application. +
**Alternative 2:** Sorts the contact list and return it. +
**Pros:** Users do not need to type the command everytime. +
**Cons:** Sort command is not undoable which means that the order of list cannot change anymore after you call it and it is less defensive because you could frequently change the original data. +

---

**Aspect:** How sort command executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts the contact list according to alphabetical order(ascending order). +
**Pros:** Easy to imlement. +
**Cons:** Less function for sort command. +
**Alternative 2:** Sorts the contact list according to different order(ascending order or descending order). +
**Pros:** Users have more choices. +
**Cons:** It will be more complex for developers to maintain and test. +

---

**Aspect:** What could be sorted +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** According to names +
**Pros:** It is useful and necessary for general users. +
**Cons:** It is too narrow and common. +
**Alternative 2:** According to address/email/phone number +
**Pros:** It provides more choices for users +
**Cons:** Because address/email/phone number is unique, most of time you could find them without sorting the list. +
// end::sort[]

=== AddEvent mechanism
The add event command is facilitated by `LogicManager` class. It allows user to add a new event to the event list. +

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 3.4)_ shows how add event command works:

image::AddEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4 AddEvent command sequence diagram_

The user enters an addEvent command, which is received by `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. +
`AddressBookParser` will firstly check the format of the parameters. If format is valid, it calls `AddEventCommand` constructor, which returns an `AddEventCommand` object. +
`Logic Manager` receives the `AddEventCommand` object and calls execute(). Then, `AddEventCommand` uses model interface to execute adding operation, and returns `CommandResult`. +
`Logic Manager` receives the `CommandResult`, and returns to `UI`. +

=== ListEvent mechanism

The list event command is facilitated by the `LogicManager` class. It supports listing all the events for user to process.

The following *_sequence diagram_* _(Figure 3.5)_ shows how the list event operation works:

image::ListEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5: sequence diagram for list command_

The user enters a listE command which is got by `LogicManager`.
`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
Then `AddressBookParser` creates the list event command object and return it.
`LogicManager` receives the command object and executes the command.
The list event command object calls `updateFilteredEventList()` in the `Model`.
Then `Model` process the event list.
The list event command object creates `CommandResult` object and return it.
`LogicManager` receives the result and shows it through `UI`.

=== DeleteEvent mechanism

The delete event command is facilitated by the `LogicManager`. It supports `undo` and `redo` as it inherits from `UndoableCommand`. Other delete commands are implemented similarly.

The following *_sequence_* diagram below, Figure 3.6, show how the delete event operation works:

image::DeleteEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.6: sequence diagram for deleteE command_

The user enters a deleteE command which is received by `LogicManger`.
``LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the user command.
`AddressBookParser` creates an `DeleteEventCommand` object and returns it.
`LogicManager` receives the `Command` object and executes it.
The `DeleteEventCommand` calls `deleteEvent()` in the `Model`.
`Model` will proceed to delete the event.
The `DeleteEventCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` object and returns it to `LogicManager`.
`LogicManager` receives the result anddisplays it through the `UI`.

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteEventCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new command to delete events. +
**Pros:** It is responsible only for deleting events, and not people. Easier to implement. +
**Cons:** Users may accidentally type in "delete" for deleting a person instead of "deleteE" for deleting an event. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify `DeleteCommand` to handle deletion for both persons and events. +
**Pros:** Users would be less likely to type the wrong command. +
**Cons:** Any changes to the deletion process of either a person or event may affect the other . Harder to implement. +

---

**Aspect:** How deleteE command executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes the event at the specified index. +
**Pros:** Easy to imlement. +
**Cons:** User has to list/sort event list first. +
**Alternative 2:** Delete the event with the specified name. +
**Pros:** Users can delete directly without having to get the index. +
**Cons:** Users would have to type more if the event name is long. It will be more complex for developers to maintain and test. +
// end::deleteE[]

=== ShowParticipants mechanism

The show participants mechanism is facilitated by `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate` and `LogicManager`. This command will help users to find participants of an event. For achieving this function, `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate` will filter the person list. This command inherits from `Command`.

The following *_sequence_* diagram below, Figure 3.7, show how the show participants operation works:

image::ShowParticipantsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.7: sequence diagram for showP INDEX command_

The user enters a showP INDEX command which is got by `LogicManager`.
`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
`AddressBookParser` will call `ShowParticipantsCommandParser` to parse the INDEX.
`ShowParticipantsCommandParser` will create `ShowParticipantsCommand` object using the INDEX.
Then `AddressBookParser` receives the command object and return it to `LogicManager`.
`LogicManager` receives the command object and executes the command.
`ShowParticipantsCommand` will create the `PersonJoinsEventsPredicate` according to the INDEX.
Then, `ShowParticipantsCommand` calls `updateFilteredPersonList(p)` in the `Model`,  which uses the predicate created before.
Then `Model` process the person list.
The show participants command object creates `CommandResult` object and return it.
`LogicManager` receives the result and shows it through `UI`.

=== Person-Event interaction
In this application, we allow users to connect events and persons to show that some persons participate some events. +
We will explain it in terms of Model and Storage. +

[discrete]
==== Model level
For model, we simply use the "referencing model", which is shown in the diagram below: +

image::DG_model_join.png[width = "800"]
_Figure ?.?.? interaction model_

Refer to the diagram above, there is a participant list in the Event model, which stores all the persons who are involved in this event.
Similarly, the participation list in Person model stores all the event in which this person joins.

Hence, we need to maintain both lists when operating `join` and `disjoin` commands.+
The following code shows how to operate `disjoin`:

[source,java]
public void disjoin(Person personToRemove, Event eventToRemove) {
    eventList.remove(personToRemove); //Maintain participantList in Event
    personList.remove(eventToRemove); //Maintain participationList in Person
    // Save changes to the storage.
}

[discrete]
==== Storage level
For storage, since persons and events reference each other, it is easy to have an *Infinity loop of reference*, as shown in the diagram below:

image::DG_infinity loop.png[width = "800"]
_Figure ?.?.? infinity loop_

To solve it, we create two storage entities: `XmlAdaptedEventNoParticipant` and `XmlAdaptedPersonNoParticipation`, both of them does not have participant or participation information.
Hence, we can avoid the infinity referencing problem. +
The updated storage is shown in the diagram below:

image::DG_join_storage.png[width = "800"]
_Figure ?.?.? interaction storage_

[discrete]
===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to implement person-event interaction. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set `participationList` in Person, and `participantList` in Event. They references to each other. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Need to maintain both lists when operating `join` and `disjoin`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use association class. +
**Pros:** Can save every participation entry. +
**Cons:** Need to implement extra storage for association class, and cost more time to operate `show person` and `select event`.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot _(Figure 4.3)_ below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.3 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested programming tasks to get started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
